# Gerhildt as a Person
This is a repository for personal development.
By listing and working on [Issues](//github.com/aberrantmedia/gerhildt-as-a-person), I can correct problems in my life and my relationships with others.

## Wh...this isn't code?
Nope. That's okay. I'm using the tools of Github to improve my life.

## Who are you?
Honestly, I'm just some random fucking nerd who spends a shitload of time on the internet.

## License?
I don't know why anyone would want to do anything with this repository, but I have licensed it under an MIT license. Just, like, in case.
